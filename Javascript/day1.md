# Episode 1 : Execution Context

- Everything in JS happens inside the execution context. Imagine a sealed-off container inside which JS runs.
  It is an abstract concept that hold info about the env. within the current code is being executed.
 

- In the container the first component is **memory component** and the 2nd one is **code component**

- Memory component has all the variables and functions in key value pairs. It is also called **Variable environment**.

- Code component is the place where code is executed one line at a time. It is also called the **Thread of Execution**.

- JS is a **synchronous**, **single-threaded** language
  - Synchronous:- In a specific synchronous order.
  - Single-threaded:- One command at a time.

 Whenever any JavaScript code is executed an execution context is created and it is the Global Execution Context.
2. An Execution Context is basically a box which has two components called Memory Component(Variable Environment) and Code Component(Thread Of Execution).
3. The Execution context is created in two phases
   a. Memory Creation Phase : In this Phase, Memory is allocated to all the variables and functions which are present in the           global scope. Special keyword Undefined in case of variables and literally the whole function in case of functions.
   b. Code Execution Phase : In this Phase, code is executed line by line.

4. Whenever there is a function invocation an all new execution context is created and same process is followed again.
5. If there is any function parameter then it is also allocated memory while creating the execution context of the function.
6. Whenever return keyword is encountered , it means the task of function is over and it returns back the control of the program back to the place where it was invoked. and with this this execution context is deleted from stack.

 Call Stack is basically a stack which maintains the order of execution of execution context. Whenever a code is executed the Global Execution Context is pushed into the stack first and later on as per the function invocation the  execution context is pushed into the stack. When the function code is done executing the execution context is popped out and last the Global Execution Context s also deleted.

 # Episode 2 : How JS is executed & Call Stack

- When a JS program is ran, a **global execution context** is created.

- The execution context is created in two phases.

  - Memory creation phase - JS will allocate memory to variables and functions.
  - Code execution phase

- Let's consider the below example and its code execution steps:

```js
var n = 2;
function square(num) {
  var ans = num * num;
  return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```

The very **first** thing which JS does is **memory creation phase**, so it goes to line one of above code snippet, and **allocates a memory space** for variable **'n'** and then goes to line two, and **allocates a memory space** for **function 'square'**. When allocating memory **for n it stores 'undefined'**, a special value for 'n'. **For 'square', it stores the whole code of the function inside its memory space.** Then, as square2 and square4 are variables as well, it allocates memory and stores 'undefined' for them, and this is the end of first phase i.e. memory creation phase.

So O/P will look something like
 

Now, in **2nd phase** i.e. code execution phase, it starts going through the whole code line by line. As it encounters var n = 2, it assigns 2 to 'n'. Until now, the value of 'n' was undefined. For function, there is nothing to execute. As these lines were already dealt with in memory creation phase.

Coming to line 6 i.e. **var square2 = square(n)**, here **functions are a bit different than any other language. A new execution context is created altogether.** Again in this new execution context, in memory creation phase, we allocate memory to num and ans the two variables. And undefined is placed in them. Now, in code execution phase of this execution context, first 2 is assigned to num. Then var ans = num \* num will store 4 in ans. After that, return ans returns the control of program back to where this function was invoked from.
 

When **return** keyword is encountered, It returns the control to the called line and also **the function execution context is deleted**.
Same thing will be repeated for square4 and then after that is finished, the global execution context will be destroyed.
So the **final diagram** before deletion would look something like:

 
- Javascript manages code execution context creation and deletion with the the help of **Call Stack**.

- Call Stack is a mechanism to keep track of its place in script that calls multiple function.

- Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts. It is also known as Program Stack, Control Stack, Runtime stack, Machine Stack, Execution context stack.
